# SafeStreets-LDN-Graph-Transformers-for-Crash-Risk-in-London
SafeStreets-LDN: Predicting London road-intersection crash risk using Graph Transformers (TransformerConv GNNs) and open geospatial data (OSM + STATS19), with spatial holdout evaluation and baseline comparisons (XGBoost, trivial models).
SafeStreets-LDN is a graph-based road safety project that predicts crash risk at London road intersections using only static, publicly available geospatial data. The pipeline combines OpenStreetMap road networks with STATS19 collision records (2020–2024), maps crashes to nearby intersections, engineers node/edge features, and evaluates TransformerConv GNNs against XGBoost and trivial baselines under spatially separated train/test splits. The goal is to support proactive, city-wide road safety screening and interpretable risk mapping for high-risk junctions and corridors.
